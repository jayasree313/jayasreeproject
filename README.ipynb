    "- Google Colab\n",
    "- Pandas\n",
    "- Matplotlib\n",
    "- Prompt Engineering\n",
    "- Generative AI Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files Included\n",
    "- `resume_generator.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and output\n",
    "- `data/sample_input.csv`: Sample user data for resume generation\n",
    "- `preview.png`: Screenshot of the final output\n",
    "- `README.md`: This file\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Run\n",
    "1. Open `resume_generator.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "2. Upload your own CSV file with user data (or use the sample)\n",
    "3. Run all cells to generate resumes\n",
    "4. Customize prompts to experiment with different outputs\n",
