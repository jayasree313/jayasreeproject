# YBI Generative AI Internship Project

## Project Title
AI-Powered Resume Generator

##  Description
This project was built as part of the YBI Generative AI Internship. It uses Python and prompt engineering to create personalized resumes based on user input. The goal is to explore how generative models can assist in professional branding.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Prompt Engineering
- Generative AI Concepts

## Files Included
- `resume_generator.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and output
- `data/sample_input.csv`: Sample user data for resume generation
- `preview.png`: Screenshot of the final output
- `README.md`: This file

## How to Run
1. Open `resume_generator.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Upload your own CSV file with user data (or use the sample)
3. Run all cells to generate resumes
4. Customize prompts to experiment with different outputs

##  What I Learned
- Basics of generative AI and prompt design
- Data handling with Pandas
- Visualizing resume sections with Matplotlib
- Structuring a GitHub project professionally
